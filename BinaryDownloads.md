# Binary Downloads #

Due to the nature of linux, and the fact that there are so many distributions and platforms for linux, there are currently no binary downloads available. Please use the source tab to checkout and compile the driver yourself.

As x360 becomes more stable and grows in popularity, I _might_ make some packages for the more popular linux distributions.

(Of course, if anyone else wants to spend time on this, they may do so.)
